# OpenSquare: a collaboration network in web3 environment

## Abstract
Blockchain bring transparency and irreversibility which will be important in collaboration based credit building. We will build a collaboration platform which 
facilitate collaborations between users and store the corresponding data to blockchain. The stored onchain objective and subjective data will be used to build users' credit
model. Finally, we will build a collaboration network which help users in following ways.
- Platforms which support collaborations like bounties, paid questions, etc.
- A profile site where users can manage their profiles with their keys
  - Onchain data will be aggregated for users
  - Credit model will be built based on the onchain collaboration data

## Collaborations
We build collaborations in web3 environment first with following thoughts.
- Blockchain based collaborations solve problems in web2.
  - Payment: crypto fund can be locked by code, while it provides a more reasonable way to handle the fund issues, especially the trust.
  - Relatively more trusted history records. Collaborators can check each other's collaboration history more easily, and the records are more credible.
- Users' credit model dimension will be composed by different indicators. Current most onchain transactions
and even DeFi behaviors are not enough to build credit which benefit users building collaborations.
