# OpenSquare: a collaboration network in web3 environment

## Abstract
Blockchain bring transparency and irreversibility which will be important in collaboration based credit building. We will build a collaboration platform which 
facilitate collaborations between users and store the corresponding data to blockchain. The stored onchain objective and subjective data will be used to build users' credit
model. Finally, we will build a collaboration network which help users in following ways.
- Platforms which support collaborations like bounties, paid questions, etc.
- A profile site where users can manage their profiles with their keys
  - Onchain data will be aggregated for users
  - Credit model will be built based on the onchain collaboration data
